# Online learning platform Tutio

This repository is the content of the practical part of the master's thesis *Designing IT systems in the Domain-Driven Design approach*.

For the thesis, an architecture design was created and a fragment of one of the microservices (connected with the booking process) of the Tutio online learning platform was implemented.

## Project repository content

This repository contains three main dictionaries:

- [`\event-storming`](/event-storming) - stores the rendered graphics created during the Event Storming session, used to define the functionality of the platform, the ubiquitous language and the division into bounded contexts;
- [`\c4-model`](/c4-model) - stores Tutio C4 diagrams prepared with Structurizr;
- [`\server-app\BookingService`](/server-app/BookingService) - includes the implementation of a representative part of the *RESERVATION* microservice, prepared following the DDD guidelines.
